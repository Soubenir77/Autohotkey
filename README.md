# Path-Of-Exile-Autopotion
Autopotion Script for Path of Exile
This is a small script i made to use while i play Path of Exile
This Script requires game to be run either on windowed or fullscreen windowed mode,wont work on Fullscreen
Also its required the flasks to be set on default game keys... 1-2-3-4-5
Usage is pretty simple
First you run the script and it asks you if you wish to run setup ....it is reccomended to answer yes if it is first time you run
the script or you wish to alter your flasks timers
Pressing YES will make a tooltip to appear which asks you to set the health  pixel at which the Flask will be used ...
This can be done by aiming at your Health globe desired pixel and pressing Z
Then A new message tooltip will pop up asking you to set the desired pixel for mana ....same procedure as health aim at
your mana pool and press Z
After that a gui windows will pop up with 5 flasks choise and 6 Timer Fields
Set which even first will trigger the flasks, that can be either Health if checkbox is checked or Mana if left unchecked
After that set the flask duration according to your in game tooltip for each flask in positions 1,2,3,4,5.The Duration must be set
in Miliseconds (ms).
You can of course set a duration of your liking but i reccomend setting the Default Flask Duration Timers mostly cause this way
the script wont over produce presses
After that set the Time interval on which the script will check health and mana level...
I reccomend using 3000ms on that field
The Script produces some *.ini files which store your settings so you dont have to redo every time you run it
So next time you will start it just dont run setup again....
THe Script exits with F12 if need be and its set to show no tray icon
Hope you enjoy it and play as much poe as you can!
