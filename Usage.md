Path of exile Automatic Flask Usage
Explanation of Script
When Run the script will ask if you wish to run Set up or no
If user chooses No The watchdog will load
if user chooses Yes the Setup will launch
It is reccomended to press yes for the first time you start the script
it is also essential to have the path of exile game up and running either on windowed mode or full screen windowed Mode
In addition all flasks keybinds must be the default (1,2,3,4,5)
If User chooses to launch setup first the script will try to set Mana and Health Coordinates and Pixel Colour which will decide
when the Flasks will be used
This can be done by aiming over your HP and MP globes in game and pressing Z key
Tooltip popping will remind you of this
Next a window will launch that will ask you to set the following
Flasks 1 to 5 are asiggned by default to be used on HP Trigger,thus the checked checkboxes on the window
If you wish a flask to fire on MP Trigger just uncheck the box
The Flask Duration is reccomended to be set according to the real flask duration so that the script wont over press keys
For example if your flask has duration of 7 seconds set the value to 7000
The ScriptIntervalTimer is essential cause it tells the script how often to check for HP and MP changes
It is reccomended to set it to a value between 1000-5000 ms
After Setup is completed all the settings are saved in ini files
So you dont have to run setup every time you start the script
It will remember your settings

I am no programmer....my self just a casual pc user and i made this script cause i like Path of Exile too much and play it often
I will try to maintain the script as much as possible and improve it
Hope you enjoy it and that it makes your PoE Experience more enjoyable
